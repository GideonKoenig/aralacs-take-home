# Endpoint issue after switching to tsx

**User**

it seems that after i switched the backend to use tsx instead of nest to start the application (maybe because of something else) the endpoint no longer works.

---

**Cursor**

I'll scan the backend controller and module to see why dependency injection isn't wiring `AppService` into `AppController`. Then I'll check the Nest bootstrap in `main.ts` and any recent changes to the start scripts.

I'm going to open the backend module and main bootstrap to confirm providers and how the app is started, and also peek at the `tsconfig` and scripts to see how `tsx` is configured.

I'll add the required `reflect-metadata` import so Nest can read type metadata for dependency injection when using tsx, then start the backend in watch mode and hit the root endpoint to confirm it works.

```typescript
import 'reflect-metadata';
import { NestFactory } from '@nestjs/core';
import { AppModule } from '@/app.module.js';
import {
    FastifyAdapter,
    NestFastifyApplication,
} from '@nestjs/platform-fastify';
import { DocumentBuilder, SwaggerModule } from '@nestjs/swagger';
import { env } from '@/env.js';
import { writeFileSync } from 'node:fs';
import { join } from 'node:path';

async function bootstrap() {
    const app = await NestFactory.create<NestFastifyApplication>(
        AppModule,
        new FastifyAdapter(),
    );

    const config = new DocumentBuilder()
        .setTitle('API')
        .setDescription('API documentation')
        .setVersion('1.0.0')
        .addServer(`${env.SITE_URL}:${env.PORT}`)
        .build();

    const document = SwaggerModule.createDocument(app, config);
    const outputPath = join(process.cwd(), 'openapi.json');
    writeFileSync(outputPath, JSON.stringify(document, null, 2));

    SwaggerModule.setup('docs', app, document);
    await app.listen(env.PORT, '0.0.0.0');
}
void bootstrap().then(() => {
    console.log(`Server is running on ${env.SITE_URL}:${env.PORT}`);
    console.log(
        `OpenAPI documentation is available at ${env.SITE_URL}:${env.PORT}/docs`,
    );
});

```

I added the `reflect-metadata` import in the Nest bootstrap to enable dependency injection metadata under tsx. Now I'll track the fix and verify the root endpoint responds without the previous error.

I'll run the backend in watch mode to verify the fix and test the root endpoint.

**User**

can you explain specifically what the problem was and what you did to solve it?
please also always do this, when you fix a bug.

### What broke
- **Root cause**: When switching to `tsx` (ESM runtime), the `reflect-metadata` polyfill wasn’t loaded before Nest bootstrapped. Nest’s DI reads decorator metadata (design:paramtypes) to inject `AppService` into `AppController`. Without the polyfill, that metadata is unavailable, so `AppService` wasn’t injected and `this.appService` was `undefined`, causing the “Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'getHello')” error.

### What I changed
- **Fix**: Import `reflect-metadata` at the very top of `src/main.ts` so the metadata API is available before creating the Nest app.

```1:6:apps/backend/src/main.ts
import 'reflect-metadata';
import { NestFactory } from '@nestjs/core';
import { AppModule } from '@/app.module.js';
import {
    FastifyAdapter,
    NestFastifyApplication,
```

### Why this works
- **Effect**: Ensures decorator metadata is available at runtime, allowing Nest to resolve and inject `AppService` correctly.

### How to verify
- Restart dev server and GET `/` → should return “Hello World from NestJs.”
- Docs should remain at `/docs`.

I’ll continue to include a brief “Root cause” and “Fix” section with every bug fix you ask me to do, and I’ll explain planned actions before executing them [[memory:8742380]].

- I added the `reflect-metadata` import in `apps/backend/src/main.ts`. You can now restart and hit `/` to confirm the endpoint works.

```typescript
import 'reflect-metadata';
import { NestFactory } from '@nestjs/core';
import { AppModule } from '@/app.module.js';
import {
    FastifyAdapter,
    NestFastifyApplication,
```

after restarting i see the same issue.
please maybe check online for other people who switched to tsx for nestjs projects, because they want to use esm over cjs.

I'll look up known issues with NestJS + tsx (esbuild) around decorators metadata and DI, and recommended workarounds or flags.

I'll add an explicit `@Inject(AppService)` in `AppController` to bypass missing decorator metadata under esbuild/tsx, then suggest switching the dev runner to ts-node ESM as the long-term fix.

```typescript
import { Controller, Get, Inject } from '@nestjs/common';
import { AppService } from '@/app.service.js';

@Controller()
export class AppController {
    constructor(@Inject(AppService) private readonly appService: AppService) {}

    @Get()
    getHello(): string {
        return this.appService.getHello();
    }
}

```

I looked into NestJS + tsx ESM issues and implemented a targeted workaround while proposing a long-term fix. I'll correct the todo status and quickly check for linter issues in the edited files.

- Root cause: Running Nest under tsx/esbuild drops TypeScript’s design:paramtypes metadata even if emitDecoratorMetadata is true. Nest’s DI uses that metadata to resolve constructor params. With no metadata, the `AppService` param is treated as `Object`, so injection fails and `this.appService` is undefined. Importing `reflect-metadata` alone can’t help because esbuild never emits the metadata to begin with.

- Fix applied: I made DI explicit so it no longer depends on design:paramtypes and ensured metadata polyfill is loaded.
  - Added top-level `import 'reflect-metadata'` in `apps/backend/src/main.ts`.
  - Annotated the constructor with `@Inject(AppService)` in `apps/backend/src/app.controller.ts`.

```6:12:apps/backend/src/app.controller.ts
@Controller()
export class AppController {
    constructor(@Inject(AppService) private readonly appService: AppService) {}
```

Why this works
- Explicit `@Inject(...)` supplies the provider token directly, bypassing the missing emitted metadata; Nest can now resolve `AppService` reliably under tsx.

Recommended long‑term options
- Prefer one of these so you don’t have to sprinkle `@Inject(...)` everywhere:
  - Switch dev runner to TypeScript compiler: use Nest CLI watch (`nest start --watch`) or ts-node ESM loader: `"start:dev": "node --loader ts-node/esm src/main.ts"`.
  - Or compile with `tsc` and run Node on `dist` with a watcher (e.g., nodemon).
- tsx/esbuild does not support emitting decorator design metadata, so DI by type will keep breaking with it.

Verification
- Restart backend and GET `/` should return “Hello World from NestJs.” Docs remain at `/docs`.

Would you like me to change `apps/backend/package.json` to use `nest start --watch` or `node --loader ts-node/esm` for `start:dev`?

```typescript
@Controller()
export class AppController {
    constructor(@Inject(AppService) private readonly appService: AppService) {}
```

okay.. I only roughly understand this.
Can you really boil it down to the simplest steps.
go through compilation, or bundling or loading or describe the normal process of whats supposed to happen, and name which process its about, and then explain where exactly it breaks, and what the changes made to fix it (it works now).

Also, will this be a ongoing issue, or is it enough to just add this injext hint everywhere (which is actually fine with me).

### What normally happens (and which step this is about)
- Compilation/transpilation:
  - TypeScript (with emitDecoratorMetadata) normally emits design:paramtypes for constructors.
  - Nest DI reads that metadata to know what to inject by type.
- Loading/runtime:
  - `reflect-metadata` must be loaded so Nest can read that metadata at runtime.

### Where it broke
- Compilation/transpilation step: running with `tsx` (esbuild) does not emit design:paramtypes, even if `emitDecoratorMetadata` is true. So the controller’s constructor has no runtime type metadata.
- Result at runtime: Nest can’t infer `AppService` from types, so it injects nothing and `this.appService` is undefined.

### What I changed to fix it
- Runtime: ensured `reflect-metadata` is loaded first by adding `import 'reflect-metadata'` at the top of `apps/backend/src/main.ts`.
- DI resolution: bypassed the missing metadata by making injection explicit in `apps/backend/src/app.controller.ts`:
  - `constructor(@Inject(AppService) private readonly appService: AppService) {}`

### Will this be an ongoing issue?
- If you continue using `tsx`:
  - Yes, implicit type-based DI will keep failing anywhere you rely on constructor types.
  - It’s sufficient to add `@Inject(Token)` everywhere you inject something (services, repositories, models, custom providers), and keep the top-level `reflect-metadata` import. This is perfectly workable if you’re fine adding the hints.
  - Be aware: some features that rely on emitted design types (e.g., DTO reflection for validation/Swagger) may need more explicit decorators (e.g., `@ApiProperty`) since the implicit metadata isn’t there.
- If you switch the runner (optional alternative):
  - Use Nest CLI watch (`nest start --watch`) or Node with `ts-node/esm`. Those paths emit the needed metadata, so you can keep implicit DI.

If you want to stay on `tsx`, I can codemod/add `@Inject(...)` where needed going forward.
