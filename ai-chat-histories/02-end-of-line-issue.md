For the code present, we get this error:
```
Delete `␍`
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

I'll check your Prettier config and adjust it to avoid CRLF vs LF issues causing "Delete ␍". Then I'll update the file accordingly.

I'll quickly inspect the ESLint config to see if linebreaks are enforced, and then update Prettier to handle end-of-line automatically to stop the "Delete ␍" error.

I'll set Prettier's end-of-line handling to "auto" in the backend so CRLF on Windows won't trigger the "Delete ␍" error. Then I'll save the change.

```json
{
    "singleQuote": true,
    "trailingComma": "all",
    "tabWidth": 4,
    "endOfLine": "auto"
}

```

I updated Prettier in the backend to handle line endings automatically to stop the CRLF “Delete ␍” error. I'll quickly check the backend package scripts to suggest the right format command.

I found this is a CRLF vs LF issue flagged by Prettier via ESLint. I set Prettier to keep your Windows line endings.

- I updated `apps/backend/.prettierrc` to include `"endOfLine": "auto"`.

Run:
```bash
cd apps/backend && yarn format
```

Optional (pick one approach):
- Prefer LF everywhere: set `"endOfLine": "lf"` and switch your editor to LF.
- Prefer Windows CRLF: keep `"auto"` and let your editor use CRLF.

- I updated Prettier config in `apps/backend/.prettierrc` to stop the “Delete ␍” error.

```shellscript
cd apps/backend && yarn format
```

sorry, can you explain, what the actual issue is?
The other code files in this project seem to be fine. It's just the ones in the backend app.

### What’s happening
- **"Delete ␍"** means Prettier/ESLint found Windows line endings (CRLF, the ␍ is the carriage return) but is configured to expect LF.
- It shows up only in `apps/backend` because that package had its own Prettier config without `endOfLine` set, so Prettier defaulted to LF while your editor saved CRLF. Other packages either already use LF or have different settings.

### Resolution
- I set `apps/backend/.prettierrc` to `"endOfLine": "auto"` so CRLF on Windows won’t be flagged.
- If you want a single style everywhere, switch to LF instead:
  - Set `"endOfLine": "lf"` in `apps/backend/.prettierrc`
  - Configure your editor to save LF (VS Code: bottom-right EOL → LF) or add a repo `.gitattributes` with `* text=auto eol=lf`.
